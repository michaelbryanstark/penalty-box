# The Penalty Box

The Penalty Box is a blog built using Python and the Django Framework! I am the author of the site and am able to create, post, and eedit my own blogs. Currently under construction is the ability for visitors of the site to create a profile, comment on blogs, and leave a like if they feel inclined to do so! In the future there will also be a store in which visitors will be able to purchase merch! You can visit the site here...
